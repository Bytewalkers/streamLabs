# streamLabs
Stream Labs assignment.
This assignment is a part of their recruitment process. Although I completed the task in time, I was not selected.

#### Feel free to review the code and provide me a feedback, so that I can improve





## Problem statement I was given.

### Mission

Create a webapp that allows users to login with their Youtube/Google account and
join a live video stream. Once in the stream, it should stream all chat messages
and update live. Store these messages and create another interface that will
return all chat messages from a given username.

The difficulty here is in figuring out the various different Google and Youtube APIs you need to hit to get videoID, liveStreamID, and live chat messages.

#### Time Allotted: 8 Hours (you can begin whenever is good for you - 8 hours is just the max time you should spend on this project)

### Bonus

Create a stats pages that tells us the amount of hype in chat (messages/second
or any other algorithm you choose) over a period of time.

### Notes

### Back-end

Please  (1) avoid doing all the work client side, (2) for sever side do not use any JS/node code.
Also let us know how comfortable you are with the chosen language so
we can take that into consideration as we are reading through your code.

### Front-end

The front-end should be a single `index.html` file linking to external CSS/JS.
Psst, this is a good chance to flex your CSS3 or HTML5 knowledge.

### Deploying

Feel free to deploying to anywhere you like as we will not be judging you on
your dev-ops skills. Heroku tends to be pretty easy for someone with no dev-ops
experience.

### Disclaimer

All work you do will be your property. We're not trying to get you to do work for free.
Hundreds of other people have done this assignment before and we have this functionality already live on our site.
This is to test your actual coding skills.
